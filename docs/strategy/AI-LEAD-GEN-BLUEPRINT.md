- No weekly insights generation

**3. Limited Analytics & Insights**
- No Google Analytics 4 integration
- No client performance dashboard
- No conversion tracking beyond form submissions
- No source attribution in practice

### üéØ TRANSFORMATION STRATEGY FOR AGENCY MODEL

**Phase 1: De-Brand & Templatize (Week 1-2)**
1. Extract all "Ellie Edwards" references into config files
2. Create client template system with variable substitution
3. Implement dynamic branding across all components
4. Test with 2-3 dummy client configurations

**Phase 2: Automation & Scaling (Week 3-4)**
1. Build automated client onboarding script
2. Implement client isolation in database and APIs
3. Create basic client dashboard for insights
4. Develop pricing and billing integration

**Phase 3: AI & Advanced Features (Week 5-8)**
1. Implement AI chat widget with RAG
2. Add review automation workflows
3. Integrate with popular CRM systems
4. Build agency management dashboard

### üí∞ BUSINESS MODEL VALIDATION

**Current Infrastructure Can Support:**
- 50+ clients on current Vercel/Supabase setup
- ¬£5,000+/month recurring revenue at scale
- 60-75% gross margins with optimized operations
- Agency white-label model with rapid client deployment

**Key Success Factors:**
1. **Rapid Deployment:** Must achieve < 30 min client setup
2. **Quality Maintenance:** Ensure consistent performance across all clients
3. **Support Efficiency:** Minimize ongoing support burden per client
4. **Feature Standardization:** Resist custom development for individual clients

**Status:** Start with MVP checklist. Focus on de-branding and multi-tenant architecture first. AI features secondary to business model validation.
