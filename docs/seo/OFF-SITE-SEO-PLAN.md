## 1) STRATEGIC PILLARS
1. Entity & Brand Authority – Consistent entity signals (schema, sameAs, citations, author E‑E‑A‑T).
2. Topical Authority – Publish + interlink layered content hub (pillar → cluster → support/snippets → case studies → CTA).
3. Digital PR & Link Earning – Newsworthy angles + data assets + expert commentary.
4. Reputation Engine – Review acquisition, testimonial reuse, case study refresh cadence.
5. Demand Acceleration – Social distribution + email nurturing + retargeting to propel organic.
6. Partnership Leverage – Co‑marketing, podcast guesting, local associations.

---
## 2) 90‑DAY EXECUTION ROADMAP
### Week 0–1 (Foundation)
- Audit existing backlink profile (toxicity, gaps vs competitors). 
- Compile competitor ref domain set (top 5 SERP winners per pillar topic). 
- Build citation & NAP consistency sheet (Name, Address, Phone). 
- Select 3 pillar topics → map 6–8 cluster articles each (intent layers: Awareness, Consideration, Conversion). 
- Draft digital PR calendar (at least 6 story angles / 90 days). 
- Create master outreach CRM sheet (Prospect, Source, Persona, Pitch Variant, Status, Follow-up Date).

### Weeks 2–4 (Launch Assets)
- Publish Pillar #1 (core guide + 3 cluster pieces + 1 case study internally interlinked). 
- Build 1 proprietary mini‑dataset (e.g., local marketing cost benchmarks) → convert to landing + downloadable PDF (lead magnet). 
- Create 10 HARO / journalist query alert filters (brand terms + thematic). 
- Initiate citation build (Tier 1: GMB, Bing Places, Yelp, Hotfrog, industry directories). 
- Gather 5 baseline testimonials (email past clients). 

### Weeks 5–8 (Acceleration)
- Launch Pillar #2 (guide + 4 cluster). 
- 2 Digital PR pitches / week (angle: data insight + expert quote). 
- Local sponsorship / partnership prospecting (goal: 3 placements). 
- Release downloadable checklist / framework (convert blog → PDF). 
- Begin LinkedIn Thought Leadership cadence (see Section 8). 
- First webinar / live session scheduled (Topic from Pillar #1).

### Weeks 9–12 (Compounding)
- Launch Pillar #3 + refresh any early posts (add FAQ schema, internal anchor improvements). 
- Update case study #1 with outcome metrics (traffic %, lead volume). 
- Second proprietary data refresh (mini‑survey of 25 SMEs). 
- Attempt 1 podcast + 1 guest post per week. 
- Launch retargeting ads (traffic → strategy call). 
- Build Looker Studio Off‑Site Dashboard (Sections below). 

### Post 90 Days (Flywheel)
- Monthly: 2 cluster refreshes, 1 new cluster, 2 PR pitches, 2 reviews, 1 webinar, 1 data update.
- Quarterly: New major pillar or mega guide; E‑E‑A‑T asset (author profile + credentials); disavow review (if needed).
