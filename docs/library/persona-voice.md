# Persona & Voice

Who’s speaking, and how do they sound?

## Persona
- First‑person singular (“I”) vs plural (“we”).
- Align with your brand (solo consultant vs agency).

## Voice
- Tone and style (e.g., friendly, confident, practical).

## Where set
- `content/settings/ai.json`. Enforce consistently to avoid drift.

## Story
Your reports showed “we” in baseline and “I specialise…” in other scenarios. Lock persona in `ai.json` to stay consistent.

## Tips
- Include audience (SME owners, startups) and locale (UK) to steer specifics.
