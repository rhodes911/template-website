# Query Expansion

Say it a few different ways to search better.

## What it means
- Enrich the query with synonyms, roles, audience, locale, and section hints.

## Why it matters
- Improves recall and relevance in retrieval.

## Where used here
- Roadmap: expand “about hero” to include brand, persona (I/we), audience (SMEs), region (UK).

## Story
Instead of “about hero”, try “About page hero for Ellie Edwards Marketing (solo consultant, UK) focused on SME lead generation.”

## Tips
- Keep it short; avoid flooding sparse retrievers.
