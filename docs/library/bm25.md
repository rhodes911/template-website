# BM25 (Better Sparse Ranking)

A tuned successor to TF‑IDF for keyword search.

## What it means
BM25 scores documents by term frequency, document length normalization, and tunable parameters (k1, b).

## Why it matters
- Often outperforms plain TF‑IDF for lexical search.
- Handles document length more gracefully.

## Where used here
- Not implemented yet; a drop‑in candidate to improve our sparse ranking.

## Story
If TF‑IDF feels a bit literal, BM25 is the seasoned librarian who also considers book length and how terms saturate relevance.

## Pitfalls
- Parameter tuning (k1, b) matters.

## Tips
- Start with k1≈1.2 and b≈0.75 (popular defaults), test per section.
