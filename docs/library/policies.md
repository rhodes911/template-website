# Policies (Keywords, Avoid List, Length Targets)

Rules that steer what is said and how long it is.

## Keyword Policy
- `includeAlways`: phrases that must appear.
- `avoid`: phrases to ban.

## Length Targets
- `minWords` / `maxWords` per field (e.g., About→Hero).

## Where used
- SEO settings (e.g., `content/settings/seo.json`) and per‑request `settingsOverride`.

## Story
Your “Keyword emphasis” run forced “small business marketing” + “lead generation”. “Avoid phrases” banned “synergy/game-changer”. “Tighter length” kept the hero short.

## Tips
- Keep includeAlways small and natural; too many can sound robotic.
