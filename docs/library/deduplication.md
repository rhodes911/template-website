# Deduplication

Don’t show the same source twice.

## What it means
- Collapse hits that share the same path (or near‑identical chunks), keeping the best‑scoring one.

## Why it matters
- Cleaner citations and more diverse context.

## Where used here
- Planned for retrieval and in report rendering.

## Tips
- Deduplicate by path first; consider chunk start/end for finer control.
