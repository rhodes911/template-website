# 📧 Complete Resend Email Setup Guide

## 🎯 **What This Does**
Sets up email notifications so Ellie Edwards gets an email every time someone fills out the contact form on her website.

## 📋 **Current Status Check**
- ✅ Resend API Key: `re_2bk6n1Fw_GMhfsen519BNAdhmWvfCn9Hq` (already added)
- ✅ Notification Email: `ellieedwardsmarketing@gmail.com` (already configured)
- ❌ Email sending is disabled in development mode (NEEDS FIXING)

## 🔧 **Step 1: Enable Email Sending in Development**

### Problem
Your email function only sends emails in production mode. For testing, we need to enable it in development.

### Solution
The email service needs to be configured to send real emails even in development mode when testing.

## 🚀 **Step 2: Resend Account Setup** 

### A. Create Resend Account (if not done)
1. Go to: https://resend.com/signup
2. Sign up with your GitHub account (you're already signed in)
3. Verify your email

### B. Get API Key (already done)
- ✅ Your API key: `re_2bk6n1Fw_GMhfsen519BNAdhmWvfCn9Hq`
- ✅ Already in `.env.local`

---

## 🎯 **Step 3: Fix Email Configuration**

### Current Issue
Email is only enabled in production mode. We need to enable it for testing.

### What to Change
Update the email service to send real emails when we have a valid API key, regardless of environment.

---

## 📧 **Step 4: Test Email Flow**

### Expected Email Details
- **From**: `noreply@resend.dev` (since no custom domain is verified)
- **To**: `ellieedwardsmarketing@gmail.com`
- **Subject**: "🎉 New Lead Alert - Ellie Edwards Marketing"

### Test Process
1. Fill out contact form at `http://localhost:3000/contact`
2. Check terminal for email sending logs
3. Check `ellieedwardsmarketing@gmail.com` inbox
4. Check spam folder if not in inbox

---

## 🔍 **Step 5: Troubleshooting**

### Common Issues

#### ❌ **"Can only send to your own email" Error (SOLVED!)**
- **Problem**: Resend free tier restricts sending to unverified emails
- **Quick Fix**: Test with your email (`rhodes911@gmail.com`) first
- **Production Fix**: Verify domain `ellieedwardsmarketing.com` in Resend

#### Email Not Sending
- **Check**: API key is correct in `.env.local`
- **Check**: Terminal shows email sending attempt
- **Check**: No errors in Resend dashboard

#### Email in Spam
- **Expected**: First emails often go to spam
- **Solution**: Mark as "Not Spam" in Gmail
- **Future**: Set up custom domain for better deliverability

#### "From" Address Issues
- **Current**: Using `noreply@resend.dev` (verified domain)
- **Future**: Use `noreply@ellieedwardsmarketing.com` after domain verification

---

## 🏥 **Step 6: Verify Complete Setup**

### Database Check
- Go to Supabase Dashboard
- Check "Table Editor" > "leads" table
- Verify new submissions appear

### Email Check
- Check `ellieedwardsmarketing@gmail.com` inbox
- Look for new lead notification emails

### Form Check
- Submit form at `http://localhost:3000/contact`
- Should see success message
- No 500 errors in browser console

---

## 🔧 **Quick Fixes Needed**

### Fix 1: Enable Development Email Sending
Update email service to send real emails when API key is present.

### Fix 2: Use Verified From Address
Either verify `ellieedwardsmarketing.com` domain OR use `noreply@resend.dev`.

Improve email error logging for easier troubleshooting.
