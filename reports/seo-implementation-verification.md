# ✅ SEO Function Implementation Verification - COMPLETE

## 🔍 **Deep Verification Results**

After your challenge to "make sure it is actually being driven from there," I conducted a thorough audit and found several pages were still using the old function signature. **All issues have been resolved!**

## 🛠️ **Issues Found & Fixed:**

### **1. Old Function Signature Usage:**
Several pages were still using the legacy `buildMetadataFromSeo(slug, seo)` signature instead of the new enhanced version.

**Fixed Pages:**
- ✅ `src/app/contact/page.tsx` - Updated to new context-based signature
- ✅ `src/app/faq/page.tsx` - Updated to new context-based signature  
- ✅ `src/app/services/page.tsx` - Updated to new context-based signature
- ✅ `src/app/case-studies/page.tsx` - Updated to new context-based signature
- ✅ `src/app/blog/page.tsx` - Updated to new context-based signature

### **2. Missing Page Types:**
The PageContext type didn't include 'contact' and 'faq' page types.

**Fixed:**
- ✅ Added `'contact' | 'faq'` to PageContext type union
- ✅ Added smart defaults for contact and faq page types in `getSmartDefaults()`

### **3. Smart Defaults Added:**
**Contact Page:**
```typescript
title: 'Contact Ellie Edwards | Get Your Marketing Quote'
description: 'Ready to transform your marketing? Contact Ellie Edwards for a free consultation and discover how we can grow your business together.'
```

**FAQ Page:**
```typescript  
title: 'Frequently Asked Questions | Ellie Edwards Marketing'
description: 'Get answers to common questions about our digital marketing services, processes, pricing, and how we can help grow your business.'
```

## 📊 **Verification Results:**

### **Function Standardization: 100% ✅**
